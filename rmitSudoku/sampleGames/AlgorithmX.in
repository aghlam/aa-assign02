1. If the matrix A has no columns, the current partial solution
   is a valid solution; terminate successfully.
2. Otherwise, choose a column c (deterministically).
3. Choose a row r such that A[r] = 1 (nondeterministically).
4. Include row r in the partial solution.
5. For each column j such that A[r][j] = 1,
        for each row i such that A[i][j] = 1,
            delete row i from matrix A.
      delete column j from matrix A.
6. Repeat this algorithm recursively on the reduced matrix A.
